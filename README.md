# Overview

`carthage-copy-frameworks` is an helper script that you can use to automatically copy every
framework below `Carthage/Build/iOS`. This way you can avoid [the official, error prone,
process](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios).

As the name implies, this is meant to be used in iOS development, alongside
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).


# Installation

    brew install lvillani/tap/carthage-copy-frameworks


# Usage

# Notes

Frameworks are not copied over and over again. This means that updated dependencies might not be
picked up until you perform a clean build.
